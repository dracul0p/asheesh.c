/*    note: recurssion
    1.any thing done by iteratiion/loop can be done by recursion vice- versa.
  2.recursion give most simple solution some times.
  3.base case ->condition which stop recursion other wise stack over flow occur,very imp/never forget.
  4. iteration has infinite loop recursion has stack over flow                                           */
